This program is our exam project in the course Software Engineering 1.

To launch the program with GUI-application run the "Main"-class.

To run through the different test scenarios run the "CucumberTest"-class.

The different white box tests can be executed by running the corresponding classes.

As for the program in general it is run by running the Main class. This opens up the GUI which we will give a brief
explanation about.
There are two tabs: One for a project overview and one for user overview.
The project overview gives an overview over all the projects, the activities in the projects and the users assigned to
the activities. It is in this tab where all the time management is done, i.e. set names and project leaders for the 
projects. Here you can also register start and end dates for both projects and activities, edit the expected hours for
an activity, and remove or add users to a specific activity. 

In the "User Overview" tab you can get an overview of all the users and which activities the users are assigned to. 
You can also see how many hours the user has registered on a given date, and which activity those hours were connected
to.
